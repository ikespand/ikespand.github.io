# Getting started with Prometheus: Setting up and monitoring a FastAPI based python application
<img style="float: right;" src="https://prometheus.io/assets/favicons/android-chrome-192x192.png">
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an opensource event monitoring and alerting system. Basically, it combines a time-series database with an alert trigger mechanism. This document summerizes my experimentation starting from installing with docker and some twicks to see what I can do with it with Python more specifically with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). As title suggests, this is just to getting started with Prometheus. One can do much more than this post with Prometheus.

## Installation
As usual, get the ready to use [official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus) which is easy to use for getting-started:

`docker pull prom/prometheus`

Then run the server as follow. In the following, we are assigning the name and redirecting docker's 9090 port to our system's 9090. As mentioned in the documentation, we can mount our configuration yml file by mapping it to `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml `. 
Alternatively, we can also mount a folder containing the yml file to `/etc/prometheus`. All settings in this file is mentioned in the [official documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).


```bash
docker run -d --name=my_prometheus_instance -p 9090:9090 -v <PATH_TO_prometheus.yml_FILE>:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```


Here, we've defined the running container's name as `my_prometheus`, therefore, after your first try in running, if you try again then you will get an error regarding the conflict in container name which is obvious.
To circumvent that, always remove the earlier container by `docker rm -f my_prometheus` or select a different name or remove the `--name` option to have a random name.
As a starting point, use the [default yaml file provided by Prometheurs](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml).
In my case (remeber to use absolute path) using PowerShell. Gitbash has issue with volume mounting so I generally try to use PowerShell on Windows:

```bash
docker run --name=my_prometheus -p 9090:9090 -v $PWD\prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus 
```

If everything went well then we can see in the terminal that server is ready and we're good to go to see the web ui on: http://localhost:9090/

## Looking at the default metrics
By default, Prometheus monitors itself which means it analyze its own performance with default settings. 
- The expression panel provides a way to write the query. In the search panel, if you'll type `up` and execute it then you'll able to see `up{instance="localhost:9090", job="prometheus"}` in Table tab. 
The `up` metric scraps all the end-points, in this case only the prometheus one. Its binary metric which means we see only 0 (scrap was failed) or 1 (scrap was success). One can see what prometheus is logging by going to [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics)
- When we click on the Graph tab then we can also see the interactive visualization. 

### [Optional] System's metrics on Windows
So, I'm using windows machine and there is [an exporter available](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter/releases) which exposes the metrics to a port which we can add to Promestheus's config file. 
- After downloading the exporter, run it by double clicking on it. You might see a warning about untrusted but click on Run Anyway. 
- By default, you can see the metrics on [http://localhost:9182/metrics](http://localhost:9182/metrics). Now, we need to tell Promestheus about it.
- But, if you remember that we run Promestheus on Windows via linux docker, so we need to pass its ip (i.e. IPv4 Address) in the promestheus config file. E.g. add following lines in the `scrape_config`. You can get ip from `ipconfig` by running it in GitBash and IPv4 is the needed one.

```bash
  - job_name: "windows_exporter"

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ["xxx.xxx.x.17:9182"]
```

Then restart the server (after killing the earlier one) to see the effect. You can again try `up` query to see if we're scrapping something. To see the results in graphs, give it a minute or so. If above IP things doesn't work for you then you can try too look for `--add-host` option in `docker run`.
This whole process became much straightforward by spinning off the official node exported from Promestheus on a linux machine. 
 

## Instrumenting a python program
As a next step in beginner's journey, I was interested in documenting a random python program. This is usually done via the client libraries which are available in commonaly used languages like Python, Java, Scala etc. These libraries are responsible for properly tracking and formatting the metrics as per the desired format by Prometheus.

### Using default prometheus_client library in Python
- As a first step, install the prometheus_client via pip : `pip install prometheus_client`
- I have a sample demo app in fast-api, for which script is as follow. You can simply save it as `fastapi-demo.py` and run `uvicorn fastapi-demo:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000 --log-level=debug --reload`. Then you can see this app in the [locahost:8000](locahost:8000). Here, I've already added few things to track metrices from our default app. Those additions are highlighted by `# prometheus` in ths script.

```python
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from fastapi import Request
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Counter # prometheus
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

app_visit_count = Counter("fast_api_app_visit", 
                          "This is help comment for user.",
                          ["app_name", "endpoint"]) # prometheus
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def home(request: Request):
    """
    Renders an HTML page.

    """
    app_visit_count.labels("homepage", "home").inc() # prometheus
    html_content = """
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Demo-FASTApi App</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h3>This has nothing to do FastAPI. It is static HTML :)</h3>
        </body>
    </html>
    """
    return HTMLResponse(content=html_content)

metrics_port = 8001
start_http_server(metrics_port) # prometheus
# %%
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app_port = 8000
    # Bind to PORT if defined, otherwise default to 5000.
    uvicorn.run(
        "fastapi-demo:app",
        port=app_port,
        host="0.0.0.0",
        reload=True,
    )
```


- Correspondingly add following to your yml files:

```bash
  - job_name: "prom_python_fastapi"

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ["xxx.xxx.x.17:8001"]
```

- Restart the docker container. If everything is fine, then you can look at [http://localhost:9090/targets](http://localhost:9090/targets) and your new app shall be there. Remeber not to use python directly which executes main because by default uvcorn will start more than 1 instance which will cause the error in Prometheus about the duplicate key.
- You can also check [http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8001/) and observe newly added `fast_api_app_visit_total` is now available and it will increase as soon as you will refresh your main endpoint i.e. [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- Now, you are good to go with Prometheus dashboard. You should able to search the newly added metric in table and in graph.

### Instrumenting starlette application with Starlette-Prometheus
Starlette is the Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework on which other libraries including the FastAPI is built on. [Starlette-Prometheus](https://github.com/perdy/starlette-prometheus). This particular library can instrucment basic HTTP request related items. 
- As a first step, install the prometheus_client via pip : `pip install starlette-prometheus`.
- Let's have a slightly different yet simple FastAPI program for us as follow. Simply copy the following code-block content and paste into a new python file named as `star-fastapi-demo.py`; and run `uvicorn star-fastapi-demo:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000 --log-level=debug --reload`

```python
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

from starlette_prometheus import metrics, PrometheusMiddleware


app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(PrometheusMiddleware)
app.add_route("/metrics", metrics)

@app.get('/hello-world/')
def hello_world():
    return "Hello World"

@app.get('/bye-world/')
def bye_world():
    return "Bye World"
```

- With the succesful launch, you can observer the metrices on [http://localhost:8000/metrics](http://localhost:8000/metrics) for histograms, counts etc. for each end point by adding only 3 lines of codes!
- Correspondingly add following to your yml files:

```bash
  - job_name: "prom_python_fastapi_star"

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ["xxx.xxx.x.17:8000"]
```

- Restart the docker container. If everything is fine, then you can look at [http://localhost:9090/targets](http://localhost:9090/targets) with green UP state and your new app shall be there.

### Instrumenting starlette application with Prometheus FastAPI Instrumentator
 [Prometheus FastAPI Instrumentator](https://github.com/trallnag/prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator) is particularly modified for the FastAPI instrumentation. Getting started with is also very simple in few lines of code only.
- As a first step, install the prometheus_client via pip : `pip install prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`.
- We'll use the same code as above with slight modification for this library. Simply copy the following code-block content and paste into a new python file named as `prometheus-instrumentator-demo.py`; and run `uvicorn prometheus-instrumentator-demo:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000 --log-level=debug --reload`

```python
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator

app = FastAPI()
Instrumentator().instrument(app).expose(app)

@app.get('/hello-world/')
def hello_world():
    return "Hello World"

@app.get('/bye-world/')
def bye_world():
    return "Bye World"
```

- With the succesful launch, you can observer the metrices on [http://localhost:8000/metrics](http://localhost:8000/metrics) similar to our last library example. With this library, we can introduce other metrices easily as depicted [here](https://github.com/trallnag/prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator#advanced-usage).
- Correspondingly add following to your yml files:

```bash
  - job_name: "prom_python_fastapi_star"

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ["xxx.xxx.x.17:8000"]
```

- Restart the docker container. If everything is fine, then you can look at [http://localhost:9090/targets](http://localhost:9090/targets) with green UP state and your new app shall be there.
- As an next step, we can try several times right queries (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello-world/) and several time wrong queries (http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello-world/xx) to have a proper logs to lay around. Now, in Graph view, we can filter as per successful queries count as `http_requests_total{status="2xx"}` or we can find total queries for a given end point with `http_request_size_bytes_count{handler="/hello-world/"}`.
