Dashboard 
======
**05.06.2020 - Discontinued permanently due to the unavailability of direct data API. **

<sub> *Usage: Select any district to view stats.* </sub>

Below dashboard shows some basic statistics. For e.g. *cumulative positive to tested %* shows how many people turns positive for a testes population, the lower the number, the better it is. A higher % indicates that government should increase testing in these districts intesively. Another data here *Recovered to total positive %*, which gives us an idea about the active cases. It simply help us to track to catergorize a region.

------
A small yet powerful visualizer for COVID-19 cases in Rajasthan. The data sources are official websites from the government and print-media. The data is updated upto 6 times a day.

*Note: I made my best effort to compile this data. However, I do not take any guarantee on the correctness of the data.*
