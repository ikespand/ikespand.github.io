# OpenStreetMap: Access, data mining and data manipulation
![OSM](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/OSM_Logo.svg "OSM")
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a wonderful source of geospatial data, constantly growing with the support of amazing volunteers. To use the data for any purpose, I like to query it via [overpass-turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/ "overpass-turbo") by using its [overpass query language (OQL)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API). For a small number of requests, we can use the default web-page for our query and export the data directly in a geojson (gpx and kml are also possible). We can also access data programmatically with Python very easily. `overpy` assist in the access and basic processing of this data. An example can be found in [a previous post](https://ikespand.github.io/posts/2020/06/RestAPI_with_Python/) where in the first part, we get the data from OSM using OQL itself. Additionally, [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/loading-data-from-openstreetmap-with-python-and-the-overpass-api-513882a27fd0) is a great article, to begin with OQL in Python. For heavy usage, I would recommend setting your own overpass server, which with docker, is quite easy. You can check out the docker setup from the [github](https://github.com/ikespand/docker-overpass-api) which is forked from [an existing repository](https://github.com/mediasuitenz/docker-overpass-api) which I basically updated for a newer working version of the overpass and some notes to troubleshoot. If you are on a smaller memory machine then you might quickly run out of memory. To overcome this, configure the docker settings along with the smaller OSM file (e.g. cropping the OSM data to a city level). One of the alternatives is to crop the data to an ROI is described in the following.

The OSM dataset can be downloaded from the generous servers of [geofgeofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de). They have organized the OSM data at different levels (e.g. planet>continent>country>state). For some regions (e.g. India), the dataset is not divided into states. In addition to it, in a certain situation (like to out of memory issue with docker as above-mentioned), we might only want to have the only subset of the entire dataset (e.g. a city). In these scenarios, [`osmconvert`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert) comes handy. The binaries can directly be downloaded and then we are good to go. With this tool, we can define a rectangle (polygon is also possible) to crop the dataset. For a detailed list of options just execute: `osmconvert --help`. After downloading data for India, we can crop the approximate region for Delhi by:

```bash
osmconvert india-latest.osm.pbf -b=76.908869,28.345084,77.443079,28.732346 --complete-ways -o=delhi.pbf
```

It is important to note that we have to provide the southwestern corner first and then the northeastern corner. Besides, we need to switch the coordinates what we get from google map.
