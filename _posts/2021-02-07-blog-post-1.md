This is a (growing) general-purpose list (for my own documentation purpose) of some of the resources which I have found very helpful.

## Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS)
### Practial courses for ML:
In my opinion, before jumping to the ML or DS theory part (or even finalizing the journey), one should learn about why ML/DS is critical and how it looks. In the end, it's just the cocktail of programming, applied mathematics, and domain knowledge. Following is the recommended list to begin with:
- An excellent overview of deep learning from Lex Fridman on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VH1Lim8gL8&list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf "YouTube").
- [TensorFlow 2.0 Beginner Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxVOdVC1P1L5z5azs0XjMsb) : Well described tutorials focusing upon TensorFlow with detailed concept from the application perspective.
- Udemy is a go-to place to learn the application part. Courses can be bought often for a cheaper price and the good part is that they are structured and everything is in one place. I really enjoyed [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/ "this course") as a first step. This course can be bought for < 19 Euro (If it's not in this price range then wait for some time, they often have a special offer like every other week).

### Theoretical resources:
- My personal favourite from [Nando de Freitas @ UBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2OtwL5T1ow&list=PLE6Wd9FR--EdyJ5lbFl8UuGjecvVw66F6http:// "UBC").
- [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmIjgmijyiI&list=PLp-0K3kfddPwz13VqV1PaMXF6V6dYdEsj "This one") is from Carnegie Mellon which covers an indepth introduction to deep learning.
- A recent [course on Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij35L2MHGzis8AEHz7mg381_) from Prof. Andreas Geiger of University of TÃ¼bingen on YouTube.
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262 "Udacity") has one very nice course on machine learning for free from Georgia Tech.
- [This free book ](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ "This free book ")is a very good starting point for Deep Learning
- Interested in autonomous driving, then [this website](https://autonomous-driving.org/front/resources/ "this website") is very interesting. 
- I really like this [free interactive book](http://d2l.ai/chapter_introduction/index.html) which also provide the codes.
- A perfect book to understand [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/index.html)
- Explainable AI: A good overview on [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV8yxwGOxvvovp-j6ztxhF3QcKXT6vORU)
