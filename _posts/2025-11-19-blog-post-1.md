## Introduction 

Although object detection may not be as trendy as LLMs these days, deploying lightweight models on edge devices can be highly satisfying—especially when solving real-world problems with limited resources.  

In this article, I document an end-to-end approach where we fine-tune a custom object detector on a [pothole dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pothole-detection).  

**Why potholes?**  
We often say that roads are bumpy and full of potholes, but hardly anyone quantifies the problem. According to [one report](https://savelifefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Road-Crashes-Due-to-Potholes_Factsheet_2017_MoRTH_SLF.pdf), potholes in India caused **9,423 accidents in 2017**, leading to more than **3,000 deaths**.

To make this use case practical, we deploy the model on an Android phone (< €200) that logs pothole detections along with GPS coordinates for later analysis. This kind of analytics pipeline can help city administrations identify high-risk regions and allocate resources more effectively (especially when combined with traffic density and other infrastructure data).

## Fine-tuning the object detector

For this use case, we use **PyTorch-based pretrained models** due to their strong community support and maturity. Specifically, we fine-tune the **YOLOv8** model from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), which offers a very simple and intuitive interface for both training and inference.

I used a Google Colab notebook for training. The full code is included below and is also available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ikespand/pyexamples/blob/master/od-pothole/finetune_pothole_yolov8.ipynb). As you’ll see, the training pipeline is just a few lines of code—thanks to the abstraction provided by the Ultralytics team.

## Deployment on edge

For deployment, we use an Android mobile phone and implement the app in **Kotlin**. Since my familiarity with TFLite in Kotlin is limited, I started from this excellent open-source project:  [YOLOv8-TFLite Object Detector](https://github.com/surendramaran/YOLOv8-TfLite-Object-Detector)

I extended the original codebase to add:  
- logging of detections  
- automatic snapshots  
- GPS tracking for every pothole event  

You can find the full project (with setup instructions) in my repository:  [Road Analytics](https://github.com/ikespand/Road-Analytics)

After deployment, the app’s detection screen looks as follows:

## What’s next?

This is a toy example using a relatively small dataset, so there is significant potential for more specialized and larger real-world datasets.  

Because we deploy on a resource-constrained device, the model was quantized to improve inference speed. With more capable devices, one could afford higher-precision models or hybrid on-device + cloud processing.
