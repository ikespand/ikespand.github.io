**January 2024**: Open-access research article on the usage of transfer machine learning and generalization on porous media flow is available in [Physics of Fluids](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/36/2/025112/3262262).

**April 2022**: Research article on dimensionality reduction and temporal modes training with recurrent neural network is out in [Physics of Fluids](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0087977).

**November 2020**: Paper regarding the reservoir computing and POD is now availbale at [Physical Review Fluids](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.113506).

**November 2020**: Made [rasta](https://github.com/ikespand/rasta) opensource which is a light weight library in Python for geospatial data (Gpx, GTFS and some navigation servies.)

**October 2020**: Our paper on non-uniform body force is accepted by Physical Review Fluids, where we have used Nektar++ CFD code. Paper is [available online](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.104604) now.

**May 2020**: Our paper on machine learning and turbulence is accepted by Journal of Turbulence. You can check out the paper by [clicking here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14685248.2020.1757685){:target="_blank"}. 

**February 2020**: I have joined Veoneer GmbH as Analytics Tool Software Engineer. I will be focusing on development of different tools and module to analyse and visualize large amount of automotive data which will support the development of autonomous vehicle. 

**October 2019**: We presented our work regarding DNS and its use in sCO2 cooler design at [3rd European sCO2 conference](https://www.sco2.eu/){:target="_blank"} which took place in Paris.
